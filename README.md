# TV Lift ![](/interface/public/app/logo.png?raw=true)

this is the firmware for a ESP8266 to control motorized sliding picture frame to reveal a hidden TV behind it

the lift can be initiated by:
* a website @ (tvlift.local)
* a hidden button under the picture frame
* connecting to the TV via Chromecast

the framework for the firmeware is based on the great work of [esp8266-react](https://github.com/rjwats/esp8266-react)
